------------------
The notebooks are written with all the parameters in the first cell.
We will see how to tune these parameters along the notebook.

For now, change : 
1. the dataset name (*dset_path*)
2. the major phase name (*major_phase_strs*), this is a list [] because you may want to filter the major phase and other minor phases you already indexed
3. the minor phase name (*minor_phase_str*)
